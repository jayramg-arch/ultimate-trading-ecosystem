# Trading Ecosystem — Deep Logic Audit Ledger

**Started:** 19 June 2026. Companion to `AUDIT_REPORT.md` (which covers the data-feed/migration fixes).
**Purpose:** an *auditable* record — every module that touches rankings gets an explicit **CLEAN** or **BUG** verdict with evidence, so anomalies are eliminated by coverage, not by assertion. Triggered by the user's (correct) observation that repeated prior "audits" kept missing silent ranking-corruptors.

**Method:** for each scoring/ranking/data module, check the recurring failure-mode classes that have actually burned this system:
(1) stale data served as fresh, (2) empty/NaN columns silently propagating into rankings, (3) silent fallbacks/`except: pass` masking failures, (4) type traps (`np.bool_ is True`), (5) miscalibrated normalization, (6) join key mismatches.

## ⚠️ CORRECTIONS TO MY OWN EARLIER CLAIMS (verified against real data 19 Jun)

Honesty over body-count. On deeper verification against the actual auto-pilot output, two of my four initial "bugs" did **not** have the production impact I claimed. Recording the retraction:

- **B1 (np.bool_ in Tech_Score) — RETRACTED as a production bug.** The trap only bites a *pure-bool* DataFrame. The real pipeline's enriched frame has many mixed-dtype columns, so `apply(axis=1)` yields an **object** row and the flag comes back as **python `bool`** → `is True` works. Proof: the pre-fix auto-pilot `FINAL_WATCHLIST.csv` shows NETWEB Tech=90, which *includes* the +20 from the flags (no-flag value would be 70). The `== True` change is harmless hardening, **not** a live fix. My "20 points silently dropped from every ranking" was wrong.
- **B2 (conviction abort-on-bad-cell) — DOWNGRADED to latent.** Real code defect, but not confirmed to have fired this run: the scored columns are mostly *absent* from `MASTER_scan_results.csv` (default 0, no raise) and the one present column has zero float-choking values. Valid defensive hardening; not a proven live corruption.
- **B3 (recovery /12 saturation) — real arithmetic bug, but its target file is currently produced by a path that skips it entirely (see B6),** so no live impact via the auto-pilot CLI; it would matter on the Web Commander path. Fix retained.

The genuinely real, impactful items remain: **P0 enrichment** (confirmed working — Hunter/Watchlist now enriched & sorted), **A1 stale watchlist** (confirmed from disk), and the new **B5/B6** below.

## BUGS FOUND & FIXED (this deep pass)

### A1 — Stale watchlists uploaded as fresh — `strike_automation.py` — FIXED ✅
When a day's scan yields 0 picks, the generator (`watchlist_manager.py`) correctly writes nothing. But the Strike sync then fell back to `LATEST_<name>.txt` **from a prior run** and uploaded those stale symbols under today's date.
- **Evidence:** auto-pilot 19 Jun log — `Rec_Climax_Bounce` scan = 0, yet sync uploaded "3 symbols"; on disk `LATEST_Rec_Climax_Bounce.txt` was dated **2026-06-12** (7 days stale). The TradingView sync (correctly) skipped — the two syncs were inconsistent.
- **Fix:** `strike_automation.py` now uses the `LATEST_` fallback only if it was modified **today** (`_is_file_from_today`); a stale fallback is skipped loudly (cleanup already purged the old list). `strike_automation.py` was the only consumer with this bug (grep-confirmed).
- **This is the exact failure the user reported** ("seeing a different version of the watchlist").

### B1 — Tech_Score silently drops the 200DMA + EMA-stack terms — `technical_enrichment.py` — FIXED ✅
`calc_tech_score` used `row.get("Above_200DMA") is True` / `EMA_Stack is True`. In the real pipeline `enrich_dataframe` builds these via `pd.DataFrame(...)`; when every row succeeds the column becomes **numpy bool dtype**, so `row.get()` returns `numpy.bool_`, and **`np.bool_(True) is True` → False**. Both +10 terms were silently dropped from every Tech_Score.
- **Evidence (tested):** `calc_tech_score({'Above_200DMA':np.bool_(True),'EMA_Stack':np.bool_(True)})` → **0**; with python `True` → **20**. Real enriched column dtype confirmed `bool`.
- **Impact:** every Tech_Score understated up to 20 pts; stocks that genuinely clear those gates got no credit over those that don't → skewed `Combined_Score`. Worst exactly when the watchlist is clean (all rows enrich).
- **Fix:** use `== True` (correct for python bool, numpy bool, and False for None/NaN/False). Verified the flags now register (NETWEB 85→90).

### B2 — Conviction scorers abort on first unparseable field — `brute_force_match_pro.py` — FIXED ✅
Both `calculate_conviction_score` and `calculate_recovery_conviction_score` wrapped their **entire** body in `try/except: pass`. A single `'N/A'`/`'-'`/`None` cell raised on the first field and skipped **all** remaining additions, silently collapsing conviction toward the 5.0 base.
- **Evidence (tested):** a strong stock with `'N/A'` in the first field scored **5.0** instead of **7.5**.
- **Impact:** conviction is 50% of `Combined_Score`; any stock with one bad fundamental cell was under-ranked.
- **Fix:** new `_safe_num()` parses each field independently (skips `'', nan, n/a, na, -, --, none`); one bad cell yields 0 for that field only. Missing-field default preserved (0.0, same as old `or 0`) → no scoring regression. Verified → 7.5.

### B3 — Recovery Combined_Score saturates above Score 12 — `conviction_passthrough.py` — FIXED ✅
`score_norm_factor = 100/12` assumed recovery `Score` ∈ [0,12]. But `recovery_screener.compute_score` maxes at **22** (rff 8 + rs 2 + corr 3 + regime 2 + stage 1 + signal 3 + vol 2 + chartink 1). Every recovery pick scoring ≥12 mapped to `tech_norm=100`.
- **Evidence:** auto-pilot actionable recovery picks scored 14–18 — all saturated to 100, so their ranking was driven by conviction alone; the recovery signal quality was washed out.
- **Fix:** factor → `100/22`. Verified Score 14 → 63.6 and 18 → 81.8 (were both 100).

---

## NEW FINDINGS — recovery ranking interconnectivity (19 Jun, NOT yet fixed)

### B6 — Recovery CLI path skips conviction/Combined_Score ranking — `recovery_screener.py` — FIXED ✅
Factored the passthrough + Combined_Score re-sort into a shared `_apply_combined_ranking()` called by BOTH `run_recovery_screener()` and `main()`. CLI (auto-pilot) and Web Commander now produce identical recovery rankings. **Note:** the on-disk `Recovery_Screener_Results.csv` still shows the old Signal+Score order until the next recovery run regenerates it.

### B5 — Recovery conviction degenerate (raw vs golden column names) — `conviction_passthrough.py` — FIXED ✅ (with documented coverage caveat)
Root cause was deeper than "wrong source": MASTER carries RAW Screener names (`Return on equity`), but the conviction scorers expect GOLDEN names (`ROE %`), so only `Debt to equity` matched and conviction collapsed to a degenerate base+D/E (~5.0/7.0). Fix: apply the matcher's rename map in `_load_master` (fixes BOTH bull and recovery passthrough). Verified — recovery conviction now varies `[6.0, 8.0, 9.5]` instead of `{5.0, 7.0}`.
- **Caveat (documented, not silently bodged):** the recovery Screener.in CSVs (`SCREENER_Recovery_*.csv`) only carry RFF fields (NI/OCF/ICR/D-E/CR/ROA), NOT the conviction fields (ROE/ROCE/promoter/div/mcap/growth). Those exist only in the Stage-2 MASTER, which covers ~16/78 recovery names. The rest get tech-only Combined_Score. Full coverage needs per-symbol `fundamental_hub` enrichment of the recovery set — flagged as optional follow-up, NOT done (changes recovery scoring weight + adds per-symbol network fetches).

### (historical) B6 original write-up — Recovery CLI path skips ranking — superseded by FIXED above
`run_recovery_screener()` (programmatic / Web Commander) calls `conviction_passthrough` and re-sorts by `Combined_Score`. But `main()` (the CLI path the **auto-pilot uses**) saves at line 2076 sorted by **Signal+Score only** and never calls the passthrough.
- **Evidence:** today's `Recovery_Screener_Results.csv` (auto-pilot output) has **no `Conviction`/`Combined_Score` columns** and is ordered Signal→Score. Running the passthrough on it manually succeeds and adds both columns — so it simply wasn't invoked.
- **Impact:** the 78-symbol `Rec_Screener` watchlist is ordered differently than the Web Commander would show for the same data. Same file, two rankings depending on entry point.
- **Proposed fix:** have `main()` apply the same `conviction_passthrough` + Combined_Score re-sort as `run_recovery_screener()` (or factor the save+rank into one shared helper both call). *Deferred for your sign-off — it changes the recovery list ordering.*

### B5 — Recovery conviction sourced from the Stage-2 master — `conviction_passthrough.py` — OPEN
`conviction_passthrough._load_master()` always reads `MASTER_scan_results.csv` (the **Stage-2** universe). For recovery, conviction should come from the recovery Screener.in CSVs (`SCREENER_Recovery_*.csv`). So on the programmatic path, recovery conviction resolves for only the ~16/78 names that happen to also be in the Stage-2 master; the other ~60 get `Conviction=NaN` and rank on tech alone.
- **Evidence:** ran passthrough on the recovery file → `Conviction` non-null for **16 of 78**; matches the log's "Screener.in overlap 18 of 78."
- **Proposed fix:** point recovery-mode conviction lookup at the recovery fundamentals source. *Deferred — entangled with B6 and changes recovery scoring.*

## H/G FINDINGS (screeners + output files)

- **`FINAL_*_RRG.csv` are 5 months stale (2026-01-30) — orphaned, LOW severity.** Written by `strike_automation.run_rrg_scan()` (a separate Strike RRG mode), which the auto-pilot does NOT invoke. Grep confirms **nothing reads them downstream** → no live data leak, but misleading clutter. Recommend: delete the stale files, or wire `run_rrg_scan` into the flow if RRG_Quadrant is wanted. (Not a ranking bug.)
- **XRay (`weinstein_xray_screener`) — CLEAN (logic verified).** Minervini (0-8), Piotroski (0-9), Overall (0-17) math is sound. The suspicious `roa_ttm > (roa_ly*100)` / `gross_margin > (gm_ly*100)` in Piotroski F3/F8 are CORRECT unit reconciliation — current-year ratios are percent (×100 at lines 179/181), prior-year are fractions (lines 172/175), so the ×100 aligns them. F5/F6/F9 use consistent fraction-vs-fraction. Data-source note: XRay uses yfinance `.info`+financials for fundamentals (not Screener.in) — works, but could be Screener-overlaid later (enhancement, not a bug).
- **Bull regime gate — CLEAN logic.** "NOT BULL" was correct: requires `close>SMA200 AND SMA50>SMA200`; SMA50<SMA200 currently → bull POS catalysts intentionally suppressed. Conservative-by-design, not inverted.
- **P0 enrichment — CONFIRMED in output.** `FINAL_Hunter_Picks.csv` etc. now fully enriched + sorted by Combined_Score; file counts consistent across the pipeline (Hunter 2 / Pullback 6 / EB 1 / Leader 5 / RS 9 / RecEB 18 / Combined 29 / Watchlist 25 / XRay 25).

## I — WEB COMMANDER INTERCONNECTIVITY — CLEAN (structural)

- **All 21 `launch_script()` targets exist** (chartink_scanner_pro, screener_fetcher/processor, brute_force_match_pro, bull/recovery_screener, xray_screener_job, watchlist_manager, strike_automation, tradingview_automation_v2, master_portfolio_sync, gmail_dispatcher, sector_manager, run_pipeline, dhan_journal_v7, pages/*). No dangling references.
- **All 38 local-module imports resolve** (ai_grading_engine … xray_screener_job). The only "unresolved" token was `concurrent` = `concurrent.futures` (stdlib). No wrong refs.
- **Compiles clean** — web commander + all 4 `pages/*.py` + xray_screener_job.
- **`run_pipeline.py` (auto-pilot) orchestration correct & consistent:** Phase 4 `perform_match` (P0/B2 fixes), Phase 4.5 `recovery_screener.main()` (**B6 fix lands here** → auto-pilot now Combined_Score-ranked), Phase 4.6 `run_bull_screener`, two-pass watchlist gen (5 then 5.6 so X-Ray picks are included), Phase 6 `strike_automation --mode=watchlist` (**A1 fix**), Phase 7 `tradingview_automation_v2 --pipeline`.
- **Caveat:** this is structural (imports/refs/orchestration + compile). The ~7,500-line per-page handler logic was NOT line-by-line audited; no evidence of dead refs, but a full UI-logic review is a separate effort if you want it.

## B7 — XRay Piotroski F9 column always 0 (copy-paste bug) — `xray_screener_job.py` — FIXED ✅
Line 112 read `p_details.get("Piotroski_Details", {}).get("F9 Asset Turnover Increasing", 0)` — but `p_details` IS already the Piotroski_Details dict, so the inner lookup returned `{}` and the **"P: F9 Asset Turnover Increasing" column was hard-wired to 0** regardless of the real check. The stored `Piotroski_Score` (correct) was therefore +1 vs the sum of the displayed P: flags whenever F9 actually passed.
- **Caught by `score_authenticity_check.py` on its first run** (Piotroski_Score == sum(P:) failed 6/25; all 6 were exactly +1).
- **Fix:** `p_details.get("F9 Asset Turnover Increasing", 0)`. The on-disk `FINAL_XRay_Picks.csv` still shows the bug until the next XRay run regenerates it (validator will then PASS).

## NEW TOOL — `score_authenticity_check.py` (confidence guarantee)
Read-only validator (~2s; wired as auto-pilot Phase 11, non-fatal). For each output CSV it RE-COMPUTES the stored score from the row's own visible columns using the canonical pipeline functions (zero drift) and confirms they match, plus per-column fill rates (distinguishing real gaps from semantic blanks). First-run results: FINAL_WATCHLIST 25/25, FINAL_COMBINED 29/29, Bull blend 3/3, **Recovery Score 78/78 reproducible**, XRay Minervini 25/25 — and it caught B7. This turns "do I trust this CSV?" into a per-run PASS/FAIL stamp.

## J / C / D / E — RESULTS (19 Jun 2026)

### J — Strike/TV porting — CLEAN (post A1 fix)
- `create_strike_csv_from_txt`: reads all symbols, strips NSE:/BSE:, chunks at 49 (correct ceil-division), one Symbol-headed CSV per chunk, no dropping. (No dedup, but source txt is from already-deduped FINAL CSVs.)
- TradingView sync (`tradingview_automation_v2`): dated files only, skips missing (line 391) + empty (395), deletes same-name lists before re-upload (dup-safe). No stale fallback (correct — the contrast to the Strike A1 bug, now fixed).
- Both syncs consume the same `Generated_Watchlists` source → consistent symbol sets.

### C — Joins/merges & column integrity — 1 LATENT BUG FIXED
- **C1 FIXED — `technical_enrichment.enrich_dataframe` index misalignment.** It dropped NaN symbols (`syms = ...dropna()`) but assigned enriched rows to `out.index[:n]` (first n labels). A blank symbol anywhere but the tail misaligned EVERY metric to the wrong stock (proven with a 3-row repro: BBB's value landed on the blank row). Doesn't trigger in today's Golden Matcher path (symbols are the non-null merge key) but is a silent-misalignment landmine. Fixed to align on the real non-null index (`_sym_index`).
- All other merges CLEAN: the `pd.merge(..., left_index/right_index, how="inner")` in bull/recovery and `concat(join="inner")` in enrichment are **date-index RS/Mansfield alignments** (correct — RS only computable on common dates); the matcher `MATCH_KEY` join is an intentional intersection with consistent `upper().strip()` keys; combined dedup keeps first occurrence (metrics identical per symbol).

### D — Silent-fallback / NaN→0 / empty-as-success — RANKING PIPELINE CLEAN
- The dangerous patterns were already remediated this audit: conviction abort (B2), Dhan silent→yfinance (now loud), recovery passthrough swallow (B6).
- Remaining `except` blocks are benign: indicator guards (return None → **visible blank**, the honest behavior you want), temp-file cleanup, optional-feature imports.
- `fillna(0)` audit: the matcher's only fillna(0) is a throwaway `_Sort_Num` sort key (blank scores sink to bottom; real Combined_Score untouched). No STORED ranking score is faked via fillna(0) anywhere.
- **Cross-domain caveat (NOT watchlist):** journal P&L display uses `BuyPrice.fillna(0)` (pages/1_home.py, dhan_journal_v7) — a missing buy price would inflate displayed P&L. Separate domain (journal, already reconciled earlier); flagged for awareness.

### FOLLOW-UP FIXES (user Q&A, 19 Jun 2026)
- **Q2 → B8 FIXED — watchlist Stage now uses the canonical WEEKLY 30-WMA (zero drift).** `technical_enrichment.enrich_symbol` now calls `bull_screener.compute_weekly_stage_and_wks` (lazy import) for Stage, with the daily proxy only as a fallback. Verified enrichment == bull_screener for NETWEB/RELIANCE/COALINDIA/TCS. **COALINDIA was Stage 3 (daily proxy) vs Stage 2 (canonical weekly)** — a +20 Tech_Score correction. The daily SMA200/50 stage was drift, not a requirement: bull_screener (and Pine's weekly-anchored stage) use the 30-WMA. Re-run the pipeline to propagate.
- **Q4 → FIXED — recovery conviction no longer rewards MISSING Debt/Equity.** `_safe_num(..., default=None)`; the +2.0 "strong balance sheet" bonus (and -1.0 penalty) now require D/E to be present. Verified: missing D/E 10.0→8.5; present D/E still scores.
- **Q1 → FIXED — recovery conviction now covers the FULL set (78/78, was 16/78).** Root cause: value-style columns (ROE/ROCE/mcap/promoter/growth) exist only in the Stage-2 MASTER; the recovery Screener.in source carries RFF fields instead. Fix: `conviction_passthrough._extend_recovery_conviction` fetches the missing names per-symbol via `fundamental_hub` (Screener.in primary), maps the units to the golden column names, and computes the same recovery conviction. Verified 16→78/78; conviction now varies 5.5–10.0 and ranks correctly (ELECON Score17+conv10 → top). Cached by fundamental_hub; failures degrade to tech-only (no regression). **Tradeoff:** adds ~1–2 min to the recovery phase on a cold cache (≈62 fetches), fast thereafter — accepted by Jay.
- **Q3 (stale FINAL_*_RRG.csv):** user will handle — left as-is.
- **Q5 (journal BuyPrice.fillna(0)):** flagged as MUST-FIX whenever the journal P&L module (pages/1_home.py, dhan_journal_v7.py) is next touched — a missing buy price currently inflates displayed P&L.

### E — Structural indicator math — CLEAN, weekly-stage drift FIXED (B8 above)
- RSI (Wilder ewm), ADX (Wilder DI/DX), Mansfield RS ((ratio/SMA−1)×100), EMA-stack (50>150>200), Above_200DMA, Dist_52WH, ATR, Vol_RelAvg — all mathematically correct. No Stage 1↔3 swap (that prior bug was in watchlist_ranker, a different module).
- **SPEC DEVIATION (flagged, not changed):** `technical_enrichment._calc_stage` classifies Weinstein stage from **daily SMA200/SMA50** ("Simplified" per its docstring), but the DNA spec anchors Stage on the **weekly 30-WMA** (and `bull_screener` uses a weekly stage). So the `Stage` column in the watchlist (→ ±15 in Tech_Score) is a daily proxy that can disagree with the canonical weekly stage. Changing it alters scoring semantics → deferred for your decision.

## MODULES AUDITED — VERDICTS

| Module / function | Role | Verdict |
|---|---|---|
| `strike_automation.py` (watchlist upload) | Strike sync | **BUG (A1) → fixed** |
| `watchlist_manager.py` (generation) | writes dated + LATEST txt | **CLEAN** — correctly writes nothing on empty scan (doesn't fabricate) |
| TradingView sync (Phase 7) | TV upload | **CLEAN** — skips missing dated file (no stale fallback) |
| `technical_enrichment.calc_tech_score` | tech half of Combined_Score | **BUG (B1) → fixed** |
| `technical_enrichment.calc_combined_score` | 50/50 blend | **CLEAN** (handles None/''/'N/A') — note: duplicated in conviction_passthrough |
| `technical_enrichment.enrich_symbol/_calc_*` | Stage/RS/EMA/200DMA/52WH/vol | **CLEAN** — Python `bool()` wraps, `pd.isna` guards present |
| `brute_force_match_pro.calculate_conviction_score` | bull conviction (50% of rank) | **BUG (B2) → fixed** |
| `brute_force_match_pro.calculate_recovery_conviction_score` | recovery conviction | **BUG (B2) → fixed**; LOGIC NOTE below |
| `conviction_passthrough.add_conviction_and_combined_score` | recovery/bull Combined_Score | **BUG (B3) → fixed**; key-symmetry NOTE below |
| `bull_screener.compute_score` (pyScore, 0-100) | bull catalyst quality | **CLEAN** — safe `.get` defaults, capped, no NaN/abort traps |
| `recovery_screener.compute_score` (0-22) | recovery quality | **CLEAN** (range now correctly consumed) |

### Logic notes (flagged, NOT silently changed — your call)
- **Recovery conviction rewards MISSING Debt/Equity:** `_safe_num` returns 0.0 when D/E is absent, and `if de < 0.5: score += 2.0` then awards the "strong balance sheet" bonus to stocks with *no* D/E data. This matches the pre-existing `or 0` behavior (not a regression introduced now), but it is a real logic smell — missing data is rewarded. Recommend: require D/E present for the +2.0. Deferred pending your decision (changes scoring semantics).
- **Duplicate blend logic:** `_calc_combined_score` exists in both `technical_enrichment.py` and `conviction_passthrough.py`. They currently agree; drift risk. Recommend consolidating to one.
- **Symbol-key symmetry:** `conviction_passthrough` strips `NSE:/.NS` from the screener side but the MASTER map keys are not stripped. Works while MASTER symbols are clean (current case); fragile if MASTER ever carries prefixes.

## REMAINING SCOPE (not yet audited — in progress)

- **C. Joins/merges & column integrity** — every `pd.merge`/`concat` in the pipeline for key mismatches that drop rows/null columns; the Screener.in→golden-schema renames; empty-column propagation.
- **D. Silent-fallback / NaN→0 / empty-as-success sweep** — ecosystem-wide `except: pass`, `fillna(0)`, empty-df-as-success, stale-cache-as-fresh.
- **E. Structural indicator correctness** — Stage/30WMA, Mansfield, EMA/SMA, ATR, 52WH math vs documented specs (RRG read-only per do-not-touch rule).

**Status:** A and B (watchlist freshness + ranking formulae — the core of "wrong lists from wrong calculations") are complete: 4 ranking-affecting bugs found and fixed. C/D/E pending.
