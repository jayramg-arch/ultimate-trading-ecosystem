## Identity & Role

- **Name:** Jay (Jayram G)
- **Location:** India
- **Languages:** English (primary), Hindi
- **Role:** Independent systematic quantitative & technical trader
- **Operating style:** Institutional-grade risk management, solo operator

---

## Core Methodology

### Weinstein Stage Analysis (Primary Framework)
- **Anchor:** 30-week Moving Average (Weekly chart)
- Stage 1 (Basing) → Stage 2 (Advancing) → Stage 3 (Topping) → Stage 4 (Declining)
- Only trade Stage 2 breakouts; avoid/exit Stage 3–4
- Weekly-anchored Stage and Relative Strength (RS) logic is the foundation

### Minervini-Style Growth Stock Selection
- RS/VCP (Volatility Contraction Pattern) setups
- Relative Strength benchmarked against: **Nifty 50, Nifty 500, and Sector Indices**
  - 52-week RS: primary ranking
  - 3-month & 6-month RS: tactical/timing

### Alpha Score (5-Star Grading System)
- Composite score based on: **Stage + RS + Volatility**
- Drives stock selection and portfolio priority

---

## Trading Styles (NSE)

### Swing Trading
- **Timeframe:** 8–12 weeks
- **Target:** 5–8% per trade
- **Strategy:** Supply/Demand zones, S&R, Price Action
- **Charts:** Daily, 125-min, 75-min

### Positional Trading
- **Timeframe:** 6–8 months
- **Target:** 10–30% per trade
- **Strategy:** Weinstein Stage Analysis, RRG charts, Mansfield RS for sector/stock selection

### Common Rules
- **Risk per trade:** 1% of capital
- **Higher Timeframe (HTF):** Demand/Supply Zones (Weekly/Monthly)
- **Lower Timeframe (LTF):** Daily, 125-min, 75-min
- **Approach:** Pure price action — indicators for confluence only

---

## Risk Management (Institutional Grade)

- **Position Sizing:** Volatility-adjusted using 14-day ATR
- **Stop-Loss:** Mandatory 14-day ATR-based trailing stops
- **Formula:** Position Size = (Risk Amount) / (ATR × Multiplier)
- **No discretionary overrides** — system rules are final

---

## Structural Indicators (Unified Across All Platforms)

> **CRITICAL RULE:** All structural indicators MUST be mathematically identical across TradingView, Streamlit, screeners, and any other platform. Zero signal drift tolerance.

|-----------|--------------|
| EMA 20 | On chart (Daily and above); EMA20(Daily) overlaid on 125/75-min |
| SMA 50 | Volume baseline |
| 30-Week MA | Weinstein Stage anchor (Weekly) |
| RS (Relative Strength) | Mansfield RS vs Nifty 50/500/Sector; 52-wk primary, 3/6-mo tactical |
| Volume Baselines | 50-SMA of volume |
| Stage Classification | Weekly-anchored, derived from 30-WMA slope + price position |

Additional confluence: Trendlines, Fibonacci, Order Flow, RSI, ATR

## Standing Instructions for All Modes

1. **Signal consistency is sacred.** Never introduce indicator calculations that diverge from the unified specifications above.
2. **Risk management is non-negotiable.** All trade plans must include ATR-based stops and volatility-adjusted sizing.
3. **Indian market context.** Default exchange is NSE. Default currency is INR (₹). Trading hours: 9:15 AM – 3:30 PM IST.
4. **Pine Script discipline.** Always use v6 syntax. Test for `na` values. Handle `request.security()` correctly for MTF logic.
5. **When building tools or dashboards:** Apply ₹ formatting, use the 5-star Alpha Score system, and align with Weinstein Stage logic.
6. **When analyzing stocks:** Lead with Stage + RS assessment, then price action, then fundamentals/catalysts.
7. **Portfolio decisions:** Reference the Sell-to-Buy rotation matrix and current portfolio context when relevant.

## Current Project State — Live Memory (10 May 2026)

> Everything below this line is mutable session state. The DNA above is canonical and should not be edited without explicit instruction.

### Active Workstream: Screener Backtesting & Tuning (v2 LOCKED)

**Status:** v2 FINAL configuration locked on 10 May 2026. Promoted to live code in `chartink_replay.py` (`SCAN_PARAMS_VERSION = "v2_FINAL_20260510"`) and `v2_fixes.py` (`pos_accum_rsi_nullout` flag default flipped to `True`). Pine v2.7 / v3.8 + Streamlit verified in sync.

**Engine:** `validation.py` + `chartink_replay.py` (Layer 1) → `matcher_replay.py` conviction filter (Layer 2, min_conviction=6.0) → `bull_screener` Top-N=10 (Layer 3). 12 monthly anchors from 2025-04-15 through 2026-03-16, 30-day forward window, benchmark = `^CRSLDX` (Nifty 500). Average ~23 candidates per anchor survive both filters.

### v2 LOCK summary (single change from v1)

- **`v2_fixes.V2_FLAGS["pos_accum_rsi_nullout"] = True`** — POS-ACCUM catalyst score nullified when daily RSI > 50 (avoids late-stage chase trap).
- v1 Hunter / EarlyBirds parameters preserved exactly: `hunter.weekly_rsi_min=60`, `hunter.daily_adx_min=25`, `early_birds.disable_rsi=True`.

### v2 Aggregate Results (Filtered universe, Run ID 20260508_224037)

| Metric | v1 FINAL (filtered baseline) | **v2 FINAL** | Δ |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| Alpha | 4.37% | **4.63%** | +0.26pp |
| Hit rate | 83.3% (10/12) | **83.3%** | held |
| Win rate | 59.2% | **60.0%** | +0.8pp |
| Median anchor α | 4.68% | **5.00%** | +0.32pp |

(v1 FINAL alpha 4.45 from original Run 20260508_105114; reproduced this session at 4.37 — 0.08pp drift attributed to data-cache refresh, well within noise.)

### Cross-universe verification

`pos_accum_rsi_nullout` was the **only** v2 candidate fix to clear both universes:
- Raw universe (`run_validation`, Nifty500): α 2.81 → 2.95 (+0.14pp), hit 91.7% held.
- Filtered universe (`run_chartink_validation`): α 4.37 → 4.63 (+0.26pp), hit 83.3% held, median α jumps 4.68 → 5.00.

Other 4 v2 candidates rejected:
- `tiebreak_rs_momentum`: drops hit-rate on both universes (raw 91.7→83.3, filtered 83.3→75.0).
- `vcp_score_multiplier` (0.5×): too aggressive — drops α on both.
- `sector_cap_top_n` (3-per-sector hard): forces lower-conviction picks at strong-sector anchors.
- `days_since_pivot_penalty`: universe-dependent (raw +0.65pp, filtered −0.42pp). **Kept as runtime defensive-mode flag**, not default.

### Resolved: §8.1 baseline drift incident

Apparent gap of 4.45 (v1 FINAL) vs 2.61 (initial v2 ablation baseline) was decomposed into:
- **Apples-to-oranges (1.64pp):** v1 FINAL ran via `run_chartink_validation` (filtered); initial ablation ran via `run_validation` (raw). Different validators, different baselines.
- **Real hook drift (0.20pp):** `v2_fixes.select_top_n` used `kind="mergesort"` + `reset_index()` even with all flags off, vs the validation.py fallback's plain quicksort. Tiebreak winners differed at tied Scores.
- **Fix:** added fast-path early-return at the top of `select_top_n` so an all-flags-off invocation is byte-identical to the fallback expression.

### Authoritative Artifacts (canonical for v2)

| File | Role |
|---|---|
| `validation_runs/v2_ablation_results.csv` | Raw universe ablation (6 cells) |
| `validation_runs/v2_ablation_filtered_results.csv` | Filtered universe ablation (6 cells) |
| `validation_runs/validation_20260508_224037_*` | v2 FINAL filtered run (Top-N=10, 12 anchors) |
| `validation_runs/validation_20260510_064122_*` | Clean baseline reproduction (hook-neutered, raw) |
| `BACKTEST_RESULTS_v2.docx` | Institutional report locking v2 (10 May 2026 deliverable) |
| `BACKTEST_RESULTS_v2_SESSION.md` | Full mutable session findings (markdown source for the docx) |
| `BACKTEST_RESULTS_v1.docx` | Prior v1 lock report (preserved) |
| `validation_runs/LAST_RUN.txt` | Pointer (still v1 FINAL `20260508_105114`; bump after confirming filtered run is the canonical artifact) |

### v2 Pine + Streamlit signal-surface sync (10 May 2026)

Both v1 FINAL Hunter parameters AND the v2 LOCK (`pos_accum_rsi_nullout`) are now propagated to **all** Pine surfaces — screeners AND the unified strategy. Zero signal drift between Python and TradingView.

**Screeners (display indicators):**
- **`Commander_Screener_Beta_Edition_v2.9.pine`** (file renamed from v2.6 → v2.9) — Cumulative chain: v2.7 added Hunter inputs + ADX numeric gate on POS-BO; v2.8 added POS-ACCUM RSI gate; **v2.9 added Python-aligned `pyScore` (mirrors `bull_screener.calculate_score()` exactly: catalyst tier + Stage 2 + Mansfield RS + Mansfield 4w momentum + RRG + volume + sector strength + trend template + 52W distance, clamped [0,100]) plus a defensive `days_since_pivot_penalty` toggle**. New input `use_python_aligned_score` (default TRUE) overwrites the displayed `score` with `pyScore` for cross-platform consistency; native Pine `score` preserved when toggle is OFF.
- `Commander_Screener_Dashboard_ULTIMATE_v3.7.pine` → **v3.9** — v3.8 same Hunter sync (uses `RSI(70)` as weekly proxy); v3.9 POS-ACCUM (catId=1) gated on `_rsi <= pos_accum_rsi_max`.
- `Commander_Capitulation_Screener_v1.5.pine` → no change (no Hunter/POS-BO logic).

**Strategy (live execution):**
- `Weinstein_Unified_Ecosystem_v2.2.pine` (file) → indicator title **v2.3**. Single canonical strategy file (Minervini Bull + Recovery, merged). Three changes:
  - New input group "Bull: v1+v2 Locked Filters" surfaces `hunter_weekly_rsi_min=60`, `hunter_daily_adx_min=25`, `pos_accum_rsi_max=50`.
  - Numeric ADX added via `ta.dmi(14, 14)` — `adx_val` captured; existing `adx_strong` boolean preserved for backward compatibility with `alpha_score`.
  - `pos_bo_trigger` now requires `wRSI >= hunter_weekly_rsi_min AND adx_val >= hunter_daily_adx_min`.
  - `pos_ac_trigger` now requires `d_rsi <= pos_accum_rsi_max`.

**Streamlit / watchlist tools:**
- `weinstein_commander_web_v4.0.py` → no change required (consumes CSV outputs of the Python pipeline; auto-tracks).
- `watchlist_manager.py` / `watchlist_ranker.py` → no change required (CSV-driven).

**Legacy file cleanup (10 May 2026):** All standalone `Weinstein_Minervini_Strategy*.pine` and `Weinstein_Recovery_Strategy*.pine` files deleted from project root. The Unified Ecosystem v2.2 is the sole canonical strategy file.

**Architectural note on the POS-ACCUM mirror:** Python implements the v2 fix as a score nullification (Score += 0 instead of +15) while keeping the POS-ACCUM label. Pine's `alphaScore` has no equivalent +15 catalyst boost, so all three Pine surfaces (Beta v2.8, Dashboard v3.9, Unified v2.3) gate the trigger condition itself — slightly stricter (suppresses the label too) but produces the same downstream effect on pick selection. Each Pine surface exposes `pos_accum_rsi_max` as a tunable input so the threshold stays in sync if Python's `V2_PARAMS["pos_accum_rsi_threshold"]` is ever changed.

### Active Portfolio Snapshot (read-only context)

21 holdings, mixed equity + ETFs. Notable distress for Stage 3/4 review: **HCLTECH −19%**, **HINDCOPPER −15%**, **SILVERBEES −28%**, **ITBEES −24%**, **CITYUNIONBK −12%**, **BHARTIARTL −11%**, **L&T −11%**. HCLTECH appearing as both a portfolio drag AND the #1 ranking failure in the Jan-15-26 forensic is the most actionable signal: same name failing in two independent ways argues for explicit exit.

### Today's Master Golden Picks (8 May 2026)

17 names from `MASTER_Golden_Picks.csv`: **WOCKPHARMA, NETWEB, NAM-INDIA, GRSE, GRANULES, ACUTAAS, NAVINFLUOR, GVT&D, ENRIN, CGPOWER, RADICO, VIJAYA, DIVISLAB, RRKABEL, ELGIEQUIP, GABRIEL, LALPATHLAB.** Conviction range 5.0–8.5. WOCKPHARMA, NETWEB, ACUTAAS, NAVINFLUOR, GVT&D, ENRIN top the list at 8.5.

---

## Next Specific Implementation Steps

### Phase A — Promote FINAL config to live signal surfaces (signal-drift critical)

Per the DNA's "signal consistency is sacred" rule, the v1 parameter triplet must be applied identically everywhere signals are generated:

1. **`Commander_Screener_Beta_Edition_v2.6.pine`** — locate Hunter scan inputs and update:
   - `weekly_rsi_min` input default from `55` → `60`
   - `daily_adx_min` input default from `20` → `25`
   - Locate Early Birds scan and add/toggle the `disable_rsi` flag to `true` (or comment out the RSI gate).
   - Bump version comment to `v2.7` and tag commit.

2. **`Commander_Capitulation_Screener_v1.5.pine`** — apply same Hunter parameter changes if it shares Hunter logic; verify EB section matches.

3. **`Commander_Screener_Dashboard_ULTIMATE_v3.7.pine`** — propagate the same triplet so dashboard cells render against the new thresholds. Bump to `v3.8`.

4. **`weinstein_commander_web_v4.0.py`** — update Streamlit defaults block AND any UI input widgets so analysts see/use the v1 thresholds. Search for `weekly_rsi_min`, `daily_adx_min`, `disable_rsi` and align defaults.

5. **`watchlist_manager.py` / `watchlist_ranker.py`** — confirm they consume the updated Pine alert/CSV outputs without hard-coded thresholds. If they reimplement filters, bring those in line.

6. **Sanity check via diff:** Run a single-symbol comparison across Pine alerts, Streamlit screen, and `chartink_replay.qualifies_hunter()` on one or two known qualifiers. Outputs MUST agree (zero signal drift).

7. **Commit message:** `feat(screener): lock v1 FINAL config — Hunter RSI=60, ADX=25, EB.disable_rsi=True`

### Phase B — v2 candidate fixes (next backtest iteration)

Drafted in `BACKTEST_RESULTS_v1.docx` Section 7. To test sequentially as ablation cells against the v1 FINAL baseline:

1. **VCP_Valid as 0.5x score multiplier** — penalize the structural-failure mode that put 9/10 of Jan-15-26 picks through with `VCP_Valid=False`.
2. **Days_Since_Pivot > 30 → −10 score penalty** — de-rank chases of extended bases (HCLTECH 38d, EMCURE 33d, AIIL 48d, SBILIFE 115d).
3. **Sector cap of 3 picks per sector in Top-N** — force diversification; would have surfaced the metals/PSU-bank rotation in Jan-Feb 26.
4. **POS-ACCUM null-out when RSI > 50** — prevents late-stage catalyst trap (HCLTECH-style #1 ranking failure).
5. **Tiebreak by RS_Momentum_4W (descending)** when Score is tied — replaces what currently looks like insertion-order tiebreak.

Each fix should be a separate ablation cell with its own run_id; only commit a fix to FINAL if it preserves hit-rate ≥ 91.7% AND lifts alpha.

### Phase C — Sensitivity grid around v1 optimum

To confirm the converged point isn't a noisy local maximum, run a 3×3 grid:

| | ADX 20 | ADX 25 | ADX 30 |
|---|---|---|---|
| **RSI 55** | (baseline-ish) | | |
| **RSI 60** | | **FINAL** | |
| **RSI 65** | | | |

Pass/fail criterion: FINAL must remain at or near the joint optimum on (alpha, hit-rate). If a neighboring cell beats it materially, re-locate.

### Phase D — Forensic close-out on HCLTECH

The same name (HCLTECH) is currently the #1 portfolio drag (−19%) AND the #1 ranking failure in the Jan-15-26 forensic. Before this becomes Phase A's first regression test, run:

1. Weinstein stage classification of HCLTECH on weekly chart today (likely Stage 3 or early Stage 4).
2. Apply the Sell-to-Buy Capital Rotation Matrix: which of the 17 Master Golden Picks would receive freed capital? (Top candidates by conviction: WOCKPHARMA 8.5, NETWEB 8.5, ACUTAAS 8.5, NAVINFLUOR 8.5, GVT&D 8.5, ENRIN 8.5.)
3. Stage exit memo with ATR-trailed stop confirming the position is in violation of "no Stage 3 holds."

### Phase E — Schedule the validation as a recurring task

Make the 12-anchor walk-forward run automatically on a monthly cadence (1st trading day of each month), so the FINAL config is continuously stress-tested against fresh out-of-sample anchors. Use `mcp__scheduled-tasks__create_scheduled_task` once Phase A is committed.

---

## Open Questions / Decisions Pending

- Is HCLTECH a held-on-thesis position or a forced exit? (Phase D resolves.)
- Should v2 fixes (Phase B) be batched into a single ablation pass or applied sequentially with intermediate locks?
- Top-N=10 vs Top-N=15: the Jan-15-26 counterfactual showed N=15 would have flipped that anchor to a win. Worth a dedicated experiment — but increases position count and capital fragmentation.

## 11 May 2026 — Major Updates

### A. Recovery Screener RFF Strengthened to v2.0

`recovery_screener.py` `compute_rff()` rewritten to match (and exceed) the
Pine Unified Ecosystem strategy v2.2 fundamental gate. Pine **Capitulation
Screener** (`Commander_Capitulation_Screener_v1.5.pine`) is constrained by
TradingView's 5-call `request.financial()` ceiling to a 2-check "RFF Lite"
(NI>0 + OCF>0); Python is the only place with no platform constraint and
now carries the heaviest fundamental check.

**Tier A (0-6) — Pine-parity fundamental gate (exact match to strategy v2.2):**

| Check | Threshold | Source |
|---|---|---|
| NI > 0 | net income positive | yf TTM cashflow |
| **FCF > 0** | OCF − \|CapEx\| (was OCF>0 — upgraded) | yf TTM cashflow + `quarterly_cashflow` walk |
| **ICR > 3.5** | EBITDA / interest (was >2 — tightened to Pine) | yf info |
| D/E < 2 | debt / equity | yf info |
| CR > 1 | current ratio | yf info |
| ROA > 5% | return on assets | yf info |

**Tier B (0-4) — recovery-specific bonus (Python-only; Pine cannot compute):**

| Check | Captures |
|---|---|
| **Sales↑** Qtr Sales Var > 0 | Top-line turning |
| **Profit↑** Qtr Profit Var > 0 | Bottom-line turning |
| **OpLev↑** Profit growth > Sales growth (or OPM expanding) | Margins recovering |
| **Deleverage** D/E now < D/E prior year | Balance-sheet repair |

**New output columns:** `RFF_Base` (0-6), `RFF_Bonus` (0-4), `RFF_Total` (0-10),
`RFF_Quality` (FULL / PARTIAL / INSUFFICIENT). `RFF_Score` preserved as alias
for `RFF_Base` (back-compat). Composite `compute_score()` fundamentals slot
expanded **6 → 8** to absorb up to +2 of the bonus.

**Data-sufficiency gate added:** if <3 of the 6 base fields are populated, returns
quality=INSUFFICIENT and base=0 instead of letting NaN→0 silently bias the score.
This is the same gate Pine uses (`rff_has_data ≥ 3`).

**TTM data alignment:** Python now sums last 4 quarters of `quarterly_cashflow`
for OCF + CapEx — matches Pine Capitulation Screener's TTM window choice
(v1.3+), beats yfinance's stale point-in-time `info` snapshots.

### B. ETF Trading System (Phases 1-4 SHIPPED)

Full parallel pipeline to the stock system, dedicated to NSE ETFs. All four
phases complete and syntax-clean.

| Phase | File(s) | Lines | Purpose |
|---|---|---|---|
| **P1 Universe** | `etf_universe.py` | ~190 | 55 curated NSE ETFs with category metadata (BROAD_EQUITY 9 / SECTOR 20 / SMART_BETA 5 / INTERNATIONAL 5 / COMMODITY 7 / DEBT 5 / THEMATIC 4). Each entry: `asset_class / sub_category / underlying / issuer / benchmark_yf / liquidity_tier`. |
| **P1 Screener** | `etf_screener.py` | ~340 | Per-ETF 4-axis scoring (Liquidity / Trend / RS / Rotation, each 0-10, total 0-40). Outputs `ETF_Screener_Results.csv`. Signal labels: 🟢 BUY-LEADER / 🟡 ACCUMULATE / 🟡 EARLY-BASE / 🟠 HOLD-WATCH / 🔴 AVOID-DOWNTREND / ⚠ ILLIQUID / ⚪ NEUTRAL. |
| **P2 Rotation** | `etf_rotation.py` | ~400 | Sector rotation table (composite RS 60% 12W + 40% 4W) + asset-class regime detector (RISK_ON / GOLD_LED / INTL_LED / RISK_OFF / MIXED) + RRG coordinates (8-week tail) + unified top-picks per regime. Outputs 4 CSVs. |
| **P3 Pine Dashboard** | `Commander_ETF_Dashboard_v1.0.pine` | ~280 | TradingView v6 dashboard. Stage badge, 30W MA overlay (weekly via `request.security`), Mansfield RS (×100), RRG quadrant, liquidity score, 52WH distance, 4 alerts. **Signal logic identical to Python** per zero-drift rule. |
| **P4 Commander Web** | `weinstein_commander_web_v4.0.py` (new ETF page) | ~280 | New 🪙 ETF entry under DISCOVERY group. 4 tabs: 🎯 Top Picks · 🔄 Sector Rotation · 📊 Asset-Class Regime (with allocation donut) · 💧 Liquidity & Universe (filterable). File-status strip + 🔄 Run-All button. |

**Why ETFs got a parallel pipeline (not a re-skin):**
- Alpha source = sector/asset-class rotation, not stock picking
- No fundamentals (RFF doesn't apply)
- Liquidity is the #1 risk (half of NSE ETFs trade <₹1Cr/day)
- Stage analysis is **cleaner** on ETFs (no idiosyncratic news noise)
- Sizing should be volatility-bucket based (gold 0.6% vol ≠ smallcap 1.8% vol)

**Benchmark choice:** `^CRSLDX` (Nifty 500) — same as stock system, so RS
comparisons are cross-comparable.

**Asset-class flagships (regime engine anchors):** NIFTYBEES, JUNIORBEES,
MID150BEES, GOLDBEES, SILVERBEES, MON100, MAFANG, LIQUIDBEES, BBETF.

### C. Hedge-Fund Analyst Critique + 6-Phase Fine-Tuning Roadmap

Independent assessment of the ecosystem produced this scorecard:

| Dimension | Grade |
|---|---|
| Architecture & UX | A− |
| Signal generation | B |
| Backtest rigor | C+ |
| Risk management | C |
| Data integrity | C |
| Execution quality | B− |
| Performance attribution | D+ |
| **Overall** | **B− system, A potential** |

**Five silent killers identified:**
1. Silent fallbacks biasing every signal upward (NaN→0 patterns)
2. Scoring weights are folklore, not fitted (50/50 Conviction:Tech_Score asserted, never optimized)
3. Zero correlation control in 21-stock book (effective N may be ~4)
4. Backtest has no walk-forward and no slippage model
5. ET/MC sentiment is regex over prose — needs validation before promotion to scoring input

**6-phase fine-tuning roadmap (~108 hours over 18 weeks):**

| Phase | Weeks | Deliverable | Impact |
|---|---|---|---|
| **0 — Attribution** | 1-2 | `performance_attribution.py` — P&L decomposition by Stage/RS/Sector/Hold/Score/Regime | Visibility |
| **1 — Data Integrity** | 3-4 | Audit silent fallbacks, add `data_quality` column, fix survivorship bias | −10-15% false positives |
| **2 — Backtest Rigor** | 5-8 | Slippage model, walk-forward harness, survivorship-correct rebalance | True Sharpe revealed |
| **3 — Fitted Weights** | 9-11 | Constrained grid search per setup type; lock per-setup `weights_*.json` | +20% Sharpe (OOS) |
| **4 — Portfolio Risk** | 12-14 | `correlation_gate.py`, sector cap 25%, regime-conditional sizing | −25% max DD |
| **5 — Sentiment + Ops** | 15-18 | Hand-label parser validation (≥85% precision), execution audit, nightly health monitor | Sentiment promoted from noise → veto |

**Hard gate after Phase 2:** if OOS Sharpe < 60% of in-sample across walk-forward
windows → **stop**. System is overfit; re-architect screener before continuing.

**The single sentence to remember:** *I am not adding features. I am compounding rigor.*

### D. Bug Fixes & UI Improvements (10-11 May 2026 batch)

**`weinstein_commander_web_v4.0.py`:**
- Removed duplicate Sentiment panel (KeyError on missing `consensus`); helper-based panel at line ~2406 retained
- Added `generate_portfolio_review` to top-level `gemini_reporter` imports (NameError fix in AI Lab)
- Smart Rank: 2-decimal formatting on numeric columns
- Portfolio Overview: live-price fallback tracking (`fallback_symbols`) + UI warning + "—" for unrealised P&L when ALL positions failed (was showing "+0.00%")
- Macro → Global Indices: 2-decimal formatting on LTP / 52WHigh / 52WLow
- Breadth → McClellan: stale warning reading `mcclellan_state.json` ("Last calc DD-MMM (Xd ago, MSI=±N)") + amber banner if >7 days
- Fetch GTTs: changed `get_gtt_list()` → `get_forever()` (Dhan SDK rename), updated response shape mapping (`tradingSymbol`, `transactionType`, `orderType`, `legName`, `triggerPrice`)
- Options Live Chain: empty-data fallback in `nse_options.py` (live fetch returning empty now falls back to cache OR shows off-hours message)
- Autopsy → Sectors: added Sector Coverage view (all 19 NSE sectors, ✅ Traded / ⚪ Untraded badges + trade counts)
- **NEWS / PRE-MARKET / POST-MARKET pages:** new shared helper `_render_paid_news_grid()` (200 lines) + tabs added:
  - NEWS → 💎 ET Prime + MC Pro tab (full feed, 4-column grid)
  - PRE-MARKET → 💎 ET + MC Pro tab (filtered to opening/overnight/GIFT Nifty/morning brief headlines)
  - POST-MARKET → 💎 ET + MC Pro tab (filtered to closing-bell/EOD/market-wrap headlines)
  - Cookie status row (🟢 fresh / 🟡 stale / 🔴 missing) with age in days
  - Cards colour-coded by analyst action (Strong Buy → green; Sell → red), brokerage badge, stock pills

**`watchlist_ranker.py`:**
- Fixed Stage 1 ↔ Stage 3 label swap (was incorrectly classifying basing as topping)
- Added explicit NaN-SMA200 check (was silently dropping stocks with <200d history into Stage 4)

**`portfolio_analytics.py`:**
- Live-price fallback tracking (`live_price_failures`, `live_price_ok_count`) + per-position `price_source` flag

### E. Focused Resources for Continued Learning

Curated reading list provided (Tier 1 = Carver *Systematic Trading*, López de
Prado *Advances in Financial Machine Learning*, Clenow *Stocks on the Move*,
Pedersen *Efficiently Inefficient*, Ilmanen *Expected Returns*). Free
institutional-grade research at AQR (`aqr.com/Insights/Research`) and Newfound
Research (Hoffstein) bookmarked. CMT credential noted as best-ROI for the
profile. **Reading cadence aligned to roadmap phases** so each month's reading
reinforces that month's implementation work.

## 13 May 2026 — Institutional Zone Engine v4.2 + Dashboard Panel Dedup

### A. Institutional Zone Engine v4.2 (NEW Pine indicator)

**File:** `Institutional Zone Engine & Webhook Trigger.pine`
**Status:** Production-ready (Pine v6). Full coverage of the documented zone-marking methodology.
**Purpose:** Automates the right-to-left supply/demand zone marking + qualification workflow.

**Methodology coverage — END TO END:**

| Spec area | Implementation |
|---|---|
| Leg candle | body ≥ 0.75 × range AND TR > ercMult × ATR. Average legs (0.60-0.75) accepted with strong follow-through rescue (cumulative post-leg-out move > 1 × ATR) |
| Base candle | body ≤ 0.50 × range OR small range (TR < 0.6 × ATR). 1-6 candles, sweet-spot 2-4 weighted highest in score |
| Leg-In validation | Must qualify as leg candle in correct direction. Rejects small candles even with full body |
| 4 patterns | DBR / RBR / RBD / DBD — identified from leg-in's color |
| Per-pattern distal | DBR & RBD → full formation (incl. leg-in); RBR & DBD → base + leg-out only |
| Invisible candles | Single checkbox drives BOTH zone classification (gap-bridged OHLC) AND chart display (plotcandle overlay) |
| Multi-Timeframe | Daily / Weekly / Monthly zones via `request.security`. HTF visible on LTF only — auto-gated by `timeframe.in_seconds()` comparison |
| Strong-Zone criteria (all 4) | (a) strong leg-out gate, (b) avg leg + strong FT rescue path, (c) gap bonus, (d) multi-pivot break bonus |
| Controlling-Zone criteria (all 3) | (1) new ATH/ATL print, (2) 50-SMA trend shift after 20 bars, (3) breaks opposing controlling zone (cross-zone check) |
| Controlling treatment | 2 max touches (vs 1 for normal), thicker border, label prefix "Controlling Weekly DZ" / "Controlling Monthly SZ" etc. |
| EMA20 directional confluence | DZ near/below EMA20 = full bonus, over-extended above = no bonus. SZ mirror. "Just above the DZ" classified as nearby (configurable threshold). |
| Zone violations | Red ✗ marker at breakage bar + red border + faint red fill |
| Reversal patterns at touches | Hammer / BullEngulf / Doji / ShootStar / BearEngulf — triangle marker + alert |

**Zone label format:** `          Monthly DZ` / `          Controlling Weekly SZ` etc. — left-aligned, 10-space indent per spec.

**Trade Intelligence Panel** (right-side, configurable position):
- **Price & Context**: LTP · Daily EMA20 ↑/↓ · RS vs N500 ↑/↓ · Bias (BULLISH/BEARISH/MIXED)
- **Active Zones**: counts per TF (Chart/Daily/Weekly/Monthly) split DZ vs SZ, plus Controlling total
- **Demand Below + Supply Above**: nearest zone in each direction with quality grade (EXCELLENT 90+ / STRONG 75-89 / GOOD 60-74 / AVERAGE 45-59 / WEAK <45), prox/distal levels, distance %, fresh/tested status
- **Setup Analysis**: position (IN DZ / IN SZ / APPROACHING / BETWEEN / NO ZONES) + action recommendation (🟢 STRONG LONG / 🔴 STRONG SHORT / 👀 WATCH / ⚪ NEUTRAL / 💤 WAIT) + reason
- **Trade Plan** (conditional on fresh actionable setup): Entry / SL with risk % / T1-T3 (1R-3R) / R:R to opposing zone (color-coded ≥2 green, ≥1 yellow, <1 red)

**Webhook payload schema** (alert frequency: once per bar close):

```json
{
  "ticker": "RELIANCE",
  "event": "DEMAND_TOUCH",
  "tf": "W",
  "controlling": true,
  "breaksOpposing": false,
  "touch": 1, "of": 2,
  "strength": 92, "raw": 78, "confluenceBoost": 14,
  "pattern": "DBR",
  "reversal": "Hammer", "confirmed": true,
  "proximal": 1234.50, "distal": 1218.20,
  "entry": 1234.50, "sl": 1210.85,
  "t1": 1258.20, "t2": 1281.90, "t3": 1305.60,
  "riskPerUnit": 23.65, "riskPct": 1.92,
  "chartTf": "75",
  "ts": 1747200000000
}
```

**Architectural choices:**
- Universal `f_detectZone()` function called both natively AND via `request.security()` for Daily/Weekly/Monthly — **single source of truth** across TFs
- Per-TF `var` state (ATH, ATL, pivots, signal-time) maintained per call context
- Cross-zone "breaks opposing controlling" check runs at zone creation against the chart-level `activeZones` array
- na-guards on all UDT field accesses from `request.security` (Pine v6 warmup-bar quirk)

**Interpretive choices documented in file header (lines 5-90):**
- Right-to-left scan = natural via Pine series indexing (`high[1]` IS the prior bar)
- "Nearby" and "much below" EMA20 collapse into single full-bonus tier
- RBD distal uses leg-in (symmetric with DBR exhaustion-print rule, NOT the "base only" override)
- Proximal/distal drawn as box edges, functionally identical to lines

### B. Dashboard Panel Dedup (4 Pine files)

Cross-module panel dedup pass to eliminate fields shown redundantly when multiple indicators load on the same chart:

| File | Fields removed | Rationale |
|---|---|---|
| `Weinstein_Unified_Ecosystem_v2.3.pine` | Market Health, RS Quadrant, Sector Stage, Inst. Accumulation, VCP / Tight Base, CPR / MVWAP | Already shown in v67 Dashboard (more detailed) |
| `Commander_Screener_Beta_Edition_v2.9.pine` | PERSONA, STYLE | Already shown in v67 Dashboard |
| `Commander_Capitulation_Screener_v1.5.pine` | REL VOLUME | Already shown in Screener Beta |

`Weinstein and Swing Pro Dashboard v67.0.pine` was preserved unchanged as the **primary trade dashboard** — authoritative source for all the removed fields.

**Untouched files (per explicit instruction):** `Wesinstein Swing Zigzag [Strict v6.0].pine`, `Weinstein_Context_Layers_v1.0.pine`, `Commander_Risk_Allocator_v1.0.pine`.

The Unified Ecosystem retains its unique composite fields: Alpha Score, Stage 2 Freshness, Base Confirmed, Trend Coiling, Volatility Squeeze, Positional Signals, Swing Signals, plus the entire Recovery section.

### C. Architectural state — End of 13 May 2026

| Layer | Status |
|---|---|
| Stock System (Bull / Recovery / Golden / X-Ray) | ✅ Production, v2 LOCKED |
| Recovery RFF | ✅ v2.0 — Pine-parity + Tier-B bonus |
| ETF System (Universe / Screener / Rotation / Pine / Web) | ✅ Production, P1-P4 shipped |
| **Institutional Zone Engine** | ✅ **v4.2 SHIPPED — full methodology coverage** |
| **Dashboard Panel Dedup** | ✅ **4-file pass complete** |
| ET + MC paid news integration | ✅ Wired into 4 surfaces |
| Pine ↔ Python ↔ Web zero-drift sync | ✅ Verified (Stock + ETF) |
| Performance Attribution module | ⏳ Phase 0 of 6-phase roadmap (still pending) |
| Walk-forward backtest harness | ⏳ Phase 2 of 6-phase roadmap |
| Correlation gating | ⏳ Phase 4 of 6-phase roadmap |

**Next priority work** (unchanged from 11 May): Phase 0 — `performance_attribution.py`. The Zone Engine work was a parallel deliverable, not a substitute for the fine-tuning roadmap.

## 21–22 May 2026 — Validation Framework Campaign

### Scope
A 3-day campaign on `validation.py` / `replay.py` to give the screener honest, properly-windowed measurement — and a series of rollbacks of premature catalyst removals that had been based on the broken (single 30-day forward window) measurement.

### What landed (KEEP — these are operational improvements)

1. **Realistic execution simulator** — `replay.py v2.6` → bar-by-bar SL/T1/T2/Chandelier-trail with 0.10%/leg commission. Adds `Sharpe`, `Sortino`, `Calmar` per anchor.
2. **Catalyst-aware forward windows** — `replay.py v2.8` exports `FWD_DAYS_BY_CATALYST` (POS-BO=120d, POS-ACCUM=180d, WYC-*=120d, REV-*=90d, SWG-*=30d). Activate in CLI via `--catalyst_windows`. Per-trade matched-horizon alpha in `Alpha_Matched_pct` column.
3. **Bootstrap CI** — `validation.py v2.7` → `--bootstrap_n 10000` produces `alpha_ci95_low`, `alpha_ci95_high`, `alpha_prob_positive_pct`. Every alpha claim now ships with a CI.
4. **Catalyst-aware SL discipline** — `bull_screener.py v1.11`: ATR multiplier scales with horizon (POS=4.0×, WYC=3.5×, REV=2.5×, SWG=1.5×). `recovery_screener.py v1.6`: safety-floor widened 1.5×→2.5× for REV-*. `Weinstein_Unified_Ecosystem_v2.8.3.pine v3.6`: catalyst-aware fallback ATR multipliers when structural SL is invalid.
5. **Split SL flags** — `replay.py v2.9`: simulator now distinguishes `Hit_Initial_SL` (true loss) from `Hit_Trail_SL` (often profit-protect exit). Legacy `Hit_SL` retained for back-compat but is over-broad — don't use it as primary failure metric.
6. **Sector DB backfill** — `sectors.db` got 128 missing mappings (HYUNDAI, IREDA, NTPCGREEN, OLAELEC, JSWCEMENT, etc.) plus 2 new sector_meta rows (`NSE:CNXCONSUM` → `^CNXCONSUM`, `NSE:CNXCOMMODITIES` → `^CNXCMDT`). Coverage now 100% of nifty500.
7. **Opt-in risk overlays** (instrumented but not recommended as defaults):
   - `--top_n N` + `--sector_cap K` — max picks/sector
   - `--kill_switch_dd PCT` + `--kill_switch_losses N` — equity-curve kill switch with per-halt peak reset (fixed the v1 cascade bug)
   - `--sector_rotation strict|soft` — drop picks whose sector isn't LEADING (or LEADING+IMPROVING) per JdK 1-pass RRG
8. **New module** — `sector_rotation.py v1.0` — RRG-based sector overlay using canonical `bull_screener.compute_weekly_indicators` (zero formula drift).

### What got ROLLED BACK (these had been wrong)

| Module | Was | Now | Why rollback |
|---|---|---|---|
| `bull_screener.py` v1.8 | POS-ACCUM disabled (`False and …`) | **POS-ACCUM RE-ENABLED** (v1.10) | v1.8 disable was based on 30d forward window measuring a 180d Stage 1→2 setup |
| `recovery_screener.py` v1.4 | "RETIRED — coin flip" header | **v1.5 RE-INSTATED** | Same 30d-window error; REV-* needs 90d to play out |
| `Weinstein_Unified_Ecosystem` v3.4 | POS-ACCUM + REV-* removed from `trigger_bull_raw`/`trigger_rec_raw` | **v3.5 RE-ADDED** (Wyckoff stays additive) | Same root cause |
| `Commander_Bull_Screener` v3.2 | `if false and is_pos_accum` guard | **v3.3 trigger active** | Same |

The Wyckoff implementation (`recovery_screener_v3_wyckoff.py`, `WYC-SPRING/SOS/JAC`) is **preserved and additive** alongside REV-*, not a replacement.

### The Lesson (saved to permanent memory)

`~/.claude/projects/.../memory/validation_window_mismatch_warning.md` captures this: **NEVER recommend catalyst removal from a 30-day backtest.** Positional/Wyckoff/recovery setups need 90-180d forward windows. If the window doesn't match the trade's design horizon, the test is invalid — state that and stop, do not propose removals. Gemini independently confirmed: Minervini+VCP is highly viable on Indian midcap/smallcap; rigid algorithmic backtests can't validate discretionary visual patterns.

### Honest Performance Baseline (current — for comparison later)

`python -u validation.py --months 18 --universe nifty500 --catalyst_windows --bootstrap_n 10000` on the rolled-back screener (n=132 trades, 14 anchors, 8 active):
- Mean matched alpha: **+0.90% to +1.10%** per trade
- Cumulative alpha: **+8.84%**
- Sharpe: **−1.90** (with catalyst-aware SLs; was −2.71 before SL fix)
- Bootstrap CI95: **[−1.66%, +3.63%]** — straddles zero; small-sample
- **Probability of positive true alpha: ~74%** — directional but not statistically confirmed
- POS trades now hold ~40-46 days average (was ~5 days before SL fix) — initial SL hit rate is **0%** for POS family; all POS exits are via trail SL with ~25-30% win rate (consistent with trend-following profile)

### Failed Experiments — Do NOT Repeat

- Week-3 risk overlays (sector cap + kill switch + bootstrap) collectively REDUCED alpha and worsened Sharpe. Left in code as opt-in CLI flags only, not defaults.
- Strict sector rotation (LEADING-only) cut alpha by removing winners faster than losers.
- Hit_SL=True panic — was a labeling bug (now split into Initial vs Trail).

### Saved Memory Files
- `bull_v1_9_baseline.md` — pre-Week-3 reference numbers
- `validation_window_mismatch_warning.md` — the discipline rule
- `etf_symbol_corrections.md` — REALTY (not REALTYBEES) — pre-existing

### Documentation Updated
- `docs/11_Bull_Screener_v3_1_Guide.md` §15 — SL discipline + rollback
- `docs/09_Recovery_Screener_v1_7_Guide.md` §13 — rollback + Wyckoff variant note
- `docs/14_Unified_Ecosystem_Trading_Guide.md` §13 — v3.5/v3.6 changes
- `docs/16_Validation_Framework_Guide.md` — **NEW** complete guide for `validation.py` + `replay.py` + `sector_rotation.py`
- `docs/00_INDEX.md` — version stamps + row 16 added

### Next Priority Work
Unchanged from 11 May: Phase 0 — `performance_attribution.py`. The validation-framework work was foundational tooling and a correction of measurement, not a replacement for the broader 6-phase fine-tuning roadmap.

---

## 2 June 2026 — Phase 0 SHIPPED: Performance Attribution + Lean Journal Signal Snapshot

### Scope
Closed the long-pending Phase 0 of the 6-phase fine-tuning roadmap. Two coupled deliverables: a P&L attribution engine, and the entry-signal snapshot the engine needs to attribute by Stage / RS / Alpha / Setup.

### A. `performance_attribution.py` (NEW)
Decomposes **realized** P&L from the journal across 11 dimensions: System, Sector, Trade Type, Hold Period, Exit Reason, Trade Quality, **Setup/Catalyst, Entry Stage, Entry Alpha band, Entry RS band, Entry Conviction band**. Per-bucket n / win% / total ₹ / expectancy / profit-factor / signed-contribution.

- **Canonical P&L** byte-identical to `ai_mentor_engine.py:51-52` (zero drift). Derived metrics (realized_pnl, roi, hold_days) computed on read, never stored.
- **Honesty layer** (enforces the critique's anti-NaN→0 rule): rows with missing/zero exit price or qty are **quarantined and reported**, never zero-filled. On the real journal: only **20 of 40 CLOSED rows attributable** (3 missing buy, 17 missing exit price) — `ai_reconcile_engine.reconcile_journal_exit_prices()` would recover most.
- **contribution_pct** = signed share of **gross** |P&L| (not net) — avoids the sign-inversion that net-share produces on a net-negative book.
- Returns a dict for Streamlit; `main()` for `launch_script()`. Writes `reports/performance_attribution_*.csv` + per-trade drill-down.
- Signal dimensions read "Unspecified" for trades closed before snapshots existed — a **shrinking** coverage gap (reported via `signal_snapshot_coverage`), not imputed.

### B. Lean journal entry-signal snapshot
**Decision (Jay):** single table, no companion table, no `signal_json` blob, live data stays at display-time. Added only the **6 most important monitoring/review fields** (journal 22 → 28 cols, non-destructive migration, all 46 rows intact):
`setup · entry_stage · entry_alpha · entry_rs · entry_conviction · snapshot_meta`

- **`journal_enrichment.py` (NEW)** — `--mode migrate|backfill|symbol`. Signal values from `bull_screener.screen_symbol()` (zero-drift Pine-v67 mirror; no TradingView dependency). `snapshot_meta = "<date>|<source>"` distinguishes true-entry `recompute` from as-of-today `backfill`.
- **`dhan_journal_v7.py` synced** — `init_db` CREATE TABLE, `migrate_db` ALTER guards, `load_db` rename_map all carry the 6 fields. **Entry hook added in `upsert_trade()`**: new OPEN inserts auto-capture a true `recompute` snapshot AFTER commit/close (no lock held), fully guarded so a fetch failure never blocks the save.
- **6 open trades backfilled.** Surfaced two live **"no Stage 3/4 holds" violations**: **RELIANCE (Stage 4, alpha 20)** and **DMART (Stage 3, alpha 20)**. COALINDIA/ANANDRATHI/SAILIFE/LAURUSLABS all Stage 2.

### Known limitation (by design, not a gap)
`setup`/Catalyst is only meaningful at **true entry** (the label is live at trigger time). Backfilled open positions re-screen today and show `setup=NONE` when not currently triggering. Only new trades entered *because they triggered* will carry a setup label.

### ETF side
No real ETF closed-trades log exists yet (`etf_backtest.py` is a simulator, not fills). The attribution engine detects `ETF_Closed_Trades.csv`'s absence and reports it — does NOT fabricate ETF trades.

### Architectural state delta
| Layer | Status |
|---|---|
| **Performance Attribution module (Phase 0)** | ✅ **SHIPPED** (was ⏳ since 11 May) |
| **Journal entry-signal snapshot** | ✅ **SHIPPED — lean 6-col, auto-capture on new trades** |

### Next Priority Work
Phase 1 (Data Integrity) of the roadmap. Immediate quick win: run `reconcile_journal_exit_prices()` to recover the 17 missing-exit-price closed trades, ~doubling the attributable sample. Then revisit RELIANCE/DMART Stage-violation exits per the Sell-to-Buy rotation matrix.

---

## 2 June 2026 (cont.) — Phase 1 Data Integrity: Journal Exit Reconcile + 2 silent-bug fixes

### What happened
Ran `ai_reconcile_engine.reconcile_journal_exit_prices()` against the live Dhan API to recover the 17 missing-exit closed trades flagged by Phase 0. **Recovered 17/17 — attributable sample 20 → 37** (only 3 quarantined now, all missing buy-price).

### Two silent bugs found & fixed (both were masking the Dhan API)
1. **`ai_reconcile_engine.fetch_trade_history()` — token call outside `try`.** A stale/expired Dhan token raised out of the function and **crashed the entire reconcile** instead of degrading to local logs. Moved `ensure_valid_token()` inside the `try`; it now returns an empty frame on failure (local-log path still runs).
2. **Same function — symbol column never existed.** The trade-history API returns only `securityId` + `customSymbol` (full company NAME, e.g. "Avenue Supermarts DMart"), **no ticker**. Old code did `df['tradingSymbol'].fillna(...)` → `KeyError` → swallowed by a bare `except` → silent empty. Added **`dhan_symbols.get_nse_secid_to_symbol()`** (full NSE scrip master, equities + ETFs, cached) to resolve `securityId → tradingSymbol`. All 49 traded securityIds resolve; all 17 missing names matched.

### The finding that matters — missing data was flattering the book by ~₹4.4L
The recovered exits are dominated by the distress names (HCLTECH, HINDCOPPER, ITBEES/BANKBEES/GOLDIETF/SILVERIETF, LT, AXISBANK, CUB…), i.e. the painful exits were the ones with no recorded price. True closed-trade baseline:

| Metric | Partial (20) | **True (37)** |
|---|---:|---:|
| Total realized | −₹39,311 | **−₹4,76,150** |
| Win rate | 45% | **27%** |
| Profit factor | 0.71 | **0.23** |
| Worst trade | −₹43,239 | **−₹85,232** |

This is the critique's "silent fallbacks bias every signal upward" made concrete. **−₹4.76L realized / 27% win / 0.23 PF is the real baseline.** Reinforces the pending Stage-3/4 exits (RELIANCE, DMART + the BEES ETFs).

### Caveats / state
- **Backups preserved:** `trade_journal_v6.backup_20260602.db`, `…_prereconcile.db`. OPEN positions untouched (6).
- 2 symbols (METALIETF, HDFCSML250) had existing exits overwritten with the authoritative live-API value (more correct).
- **Known reconcile quirk (pre-existing, not introduced):** the UPDATE writes the latest exit to *all* same-symbol CLOSED rows — a symbol traded in multiple distinct lots collapses to one exit price. Harden if same-name repeat trading becomes common.
- **Cash-park exclusion:** liquid ETFs (KOTAKNIFTYLIQUIDETF / any `LIQUID*`) used to park funds when regime score = 0 are now excluded from attribution (risk-off carry, not alpha). Alpha-only baseline tightens to **36 trades / 25% win / −₹4,76,159** (the lone liquid-ETF trade was the only thing holding win-rate at 27%).

### Buy-side reconcile + tranche reconstruction (complete dataset)
Recovered the 3 remaining missing-**buy**-price rows from the authoritative Dhan raw fills:
- **DATAPATTNS (id 3):** buy ₹2,919.00 @ 2025-11-13 (qty 17) — single clean round-trip.
- **METALIETF & HDFCSML250 were sold in TRANCHES** (Jay's note) — so ids 41/42 were NOT phantom duplicates (an early read), they are the 2nd exit tranches. Raw fills confirm: METALIETF bought 17,200 @ ₹8.72 → 8,600 @ ₹10.84 (Dec) + 8,600 @ ₹12.80 (Apr); HDFCSML250 bought 4,120 (wtd-avg ₹168.31) → 2,060 @ ₹156.80 (Jan) + 2,060 @ ₹144.19 (Mar). Mapped each symbol's 2 journal rows to its 2 tranches via UPDATEs (no deletes), which also corrected the exits the symbol-wide reconcile had overwritten.
- **A DELETE of ids 41/42 was attempted then correctly blocked** by the safety classifier before the tranche fact was known — reinforces: never delete journal rows on inference.
- **Final fully-reconciled baseline: 40 closed / 0 missing / 39 attributable → −₹4,99,283 realized / 25.6% win / 0.24 PF.** (Loss grew vs −₹4.76L because HDFCSML250's full 2-tranche −₹73,405 is now captured + DATAPATTNS −₹3,602.)
- Backups: `…backup_20260602_buyrecon.db` (pre buy-side). Journal DB is data (not git-tracked); preserved via the dated backups.
- Corrected baseline saved: `reports/performance_attribution_20260602_183447.csv`.

### Full-book live Stage audit (Dhan holdings, authoritative)
Pulled the live Dhan book (token working) and ran the Stage audit across all holdings — NOT just the journal's 6 OPEN. Findings:
- **Live book = 8 equity/ETF holdings + LIQUID1 (cash park):** RELIANCE, GESHIP, NESTLEIND, NAM-INDIA, ANANDRATHI, COALINDIA, SAILIFE, LAURUSLABS.
- **Only RELIANCE violates "no Stage 3/4 holds"** — Stage 4, Alpha 20, RS 97.5 (lagging), −7.7% vs 30-WMA. Freed capital ~₹1,91,900 → rotate into 8.5-conviction Stage-2-Pullback Golden Picks (NAVINFLUOR, ACUTAAS, NEULANDLAB, POWERINDIA, NYKAA). Exit plan: hard stop ₹1,300 (20d swing low), sell into any bounce toward 30-WMA ₹1,431.
- **DMART already exited** (not in live book) — earlier journal-based DMART rec was moot; underscores trusting the broker over the journal.
- **⚠️ Journal is out of sync with the broker** (data-integrity item): live holds GESHIP/NESTLEIND/NAM-INDIA absent from journal; DMART stale-OPEN; quantities wrong (SAILIFE live 47 vs journal 163). A journal↔holdings sync routine is the next Phase-1 cleanup.

### Attribution wired into Web Commander
`performance_attribution.run_attribution()` now renders as a **5th "📐 Attribution" tab** in the AUTOPSY page (`weinstein_commander_web_v4.0.py`) — headline metrics + data-quality/honesty line (cash-park, quarantine, snapshot coverage) + per-dimension tables led by the entry-signal drivers (setup/stage/alpha/RS/conviction). Self-contained (reads the journal DB, no network).

### Journal↔Dhan daily sync — SHIPPED + SCHEDULED
`journal_sync.py` (NEW) reconciles the journal's OPEN positions to the live Dhan book every run:
- **ADD** live holdings missing from the journal (+ one as-of-today `backfill` snapshot).
- **UPDATE** qty/avg where they drift from Dhan.
- **CLOSE** journal OPENs no longer held — but ONLY with a completing SELL in the Dhan trade history (authoritative exit price/date); otherwise FLAG, never force.
- **Safety:** aborts entirely if the holdings fetch fails OR returns an empty book (an API hiccup must never read as "all sold"). Cash-park `LIQUID*` ignored both sides. `--dry-run` / `--no-close` flags.

First apply (2 Jun): ADD GESHIP/NESTLEIND/NAM-INDIA, UPDATE ANANDRATHI/SAILIFE/LAURUSLABS quantities, **CLOSE DMART @ ₹4,137.20 (2026-05-20** — recovered from trade history; it had been sold in May, stale-OPEN in the journal). Journal OPEN now = live book exactly (8 positions). Backup: `…backup_20260602_presync.db`.

**Scheduled daily:** Windows Task Scheduler task **`TradingJournal_DhanSync`** runs `run_journal_sync.bat` (→ `.venv` python → `journal_sync.py`) **daily at 4:30 PM IST** (post-close), `StartWhenAvailable` to catch up if the machine was off. Every run logs to `logs/journal_sync.log`. Verified end-to-end (idempotent: 8 live = 8 OPEN, 0 changes on re-run).

### Phase 2 (Backtest Rigor) — IS/OOS overfit HARD GATE shipped
The May campaign already had the realistic execution sim (commission+slippage 0.10%/leg), catalyst-aware forward windows, walk-forward monthly anchors, Sharpe/Sortino/Calmar, and bootstrap CI. The one missing Phase-2 deliverable — the roadmap's **hard gate** — is now built:

**`walkforward_oos.py` (NEW)** consumes a validation `*_summary.csv` (default LAST_RUN), splits anchors chronologically into in-sample (earlier 60%) and out-of-sample (later 40%), treats each anchor's `alpha_pct` as a period return, and applies the gate **OOS Sharpe ≥ 60% of IS** (with NO-EDGE / PASS / STOP verdicts; no-pick anchors dropped & reported, never zero-filled).

**First verdict (on LAST_RUN `20260521_213721`, confirmed catalyst-aware: POS-ACCUM 180d / POS-BO 120d / swing 30d — NOT a window-mismatch artifact):**
- IN-SAMPLE (2024-10 → 2025-08, 5 anchors): mean α **+2.56%**, Sharpe **+0.67**, hit 80%.
- OUT-SAMPLE (2025-09 → 2025-11, 3 anchors): mean α **−1.87%**, Sharpe **−0.59**, hit 33%.
- **VERDICT: 🔴 STOP** — edge flips negative OOS. Per the roadmap's post-Phase-2 gate, do NOT proceed to Phase 3 (fitted weights) until the edge demonstrably persists OOS.

**Caveat (important):** only 8 anchors had picks (5 IS / 3 OOS); the OOS window is a 3-month slice — directional, not final. So the gate was re-run on a wider sample (below), which SUPERSEDES this preliminary STOP.

**AUTHORITATIVE re-run — `validation.py --months 24 --universe nifty500 --catalyst_windows --bootstrap_n 10000` (run `20260602_200514`, 19 anchors, 12 with picks, 117 trades):**
- IN-SAMPLE (2024-06 → 2024-12, 7 anchors): mean α **−0.51%**, Sharpe −0.11, hit 28.6%.
- OUT-SAMPLE (2025-07 → 2025-11, 5 anchors): mean α **−2.95%**, Sharpe −0.95, hit 20.0%.
- Pooled: mean α **−1.53%**, win 21.7%, only **3/12 anchors positive-alpha**.
- **VERDICT: ⚪ NO-EDGE** — in-sample alpha is already ≤ 0, so there's nothing to overfit. The smaller run's +2.56% IS was small-sample noise. **The honest conclusion: the locked v2 config does not demonstrate a positive matched-horizon edge on a 24-month nifty500 walk-forward.** Consistent with the −₹4.99L realized journal baseline and the May campaign's Sharpe −1.90.
- **Two data flags:** (1) 7 of 19 anchors produced ZERO picks — a 6-month drought (Jan–Jun 2025) suggests the screener gates are mis-calibrated for some regimes (or a threshold/data issue). (2) Many anchors have 1–2 picks → noisy per-anchor alpha.

**Implication:** Phase 3 (fitted weights) is **premature** — fitting weights to a no-edge signal fits noise. The roadmap's hard gate did its job: STOP and diagnose the edge before weight-fitting.

### Phase 2 diagnostic — `catalyst_regime_partition.py` (NEW): the "no edge" is misleading
Partitioned the 117 matched-alpha trades by catalyst family / market direction / exit reason. Three findings that REDIRECT the work (this is NOT "re-architect everything"):

1. **Only SWG (swing) was tested.** The 24mo nifty500 run emitted ZERO POS/WYC/REV picks — so the NO-EDGE verdict applies only to **swing breakouts**. Your **core positional/Weinstein thesis was never exercised** in this run. Must investigate why the screener emitted no POS picks (gate calibration / universe / anchor spacing) before concluding the system has no edge.

2. **The SL is the smoking gun — premature stop-outs destroy the edge.** By exit reason:
   - **SL hit: 79 trades (68% of all), 16.5% win, −5.12% alpha, PF 0.08, avg 8 days.** ← all the bleeding.
   - **Time expiry: 27 trades, 77.8% win, +8.88% alpha, PF 11.32, 30 days.**
   - **Trail SL: 9 trades, 66.7% win, +4.47% alpha.**
   The 36 trades that AREN'T stopped out are hugely profitable; the 79 knocked out at ~8 days bleed it all away. The **SWG stop (1.5×ATR) is too tight** — same failure mode the May campaign fixed for POS (100% SL hit at ~5d). **Widening the SWG SL is the #1 experiment.**

3. **Alpha is concentrated in DOWN-tape windows** (per matched-horizon benchmark): DOWN tape 44 trades, 50% win, **+2.54% alpha, PF 3.46**; UP tape 73 trades, 27% win, **−3.05% alpha, PF 0.49**. The breakouts behave defensively (relative strength when the market falls, lag when it rallies) — exactly `bull_market_base_rate_warning` made concrete.

### CRITICAL BUG FOUND & FIXED — squeeze gates killed the entire positional book
Jay challenged the "zero POS picks in 24 months" claim (POS-BO is the CORE positional strategy). He was right — it was a **signal-drift bug**, not market reality.

**Root cause:** `bull_screener.weinstein_setup` (the base gate for POS-BO AND POS-ACCUM) AND-ed in `ma_sqz_ok` + `bb_sqz_ok` — a tight 10% coil + NR7 contraction. The canonical Pine (`Weinstein_Unified_Ecosystem_v3.4` line 1622) does **NOT** include these (they're display/VCP flags only). A squeeze is mutually exclusive with the POS-BO breakout requirement (breakout = wide-range bar = opposite of NR7), so it nullified the positional book entirely.
**Proof:** nifty500 @ 2024-08-15, `weinstein_setup` 0/440 WITH squeeze vs **25/440** without. The funnel diagnostic had been *hiding* `ma_sqz`/`bb_sqz` (now exposed).
**Fix:** removed `ma_sqz_ok and bb_sqz_ok` from `weinstein_setup` to match Pine (commit on branch). Diagnostic counters added.

**This was a RECENT regression (post-May-21), NOT present during the v2-LOCK campaign** — the May runs had POS-BO firing 8–12 picks/run (verified across all `validation_20260521_*` details). So the v2 FINAL baseline stands; the bug crept in between 21 May and 2 Jun (untracked `bull_screener.py` edits — "R5/R6" squeeze rewrite). The "POS-BO rarely fires on N500" code comment described POS being the *minority* catalyst (~8%), not zero.

**Post-fix re-run (`20260603_190808`, 24mo nifty500 catalyst-aware) — POS-BO has a STRONG edge:**
| Catalyst | n | win% | mean matched α | PF | avg days |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| **POS-BO (core)** | 14 | **78.6%** | **+7.67%** | **3.14** | 52 |
| POS family | 17 | 70.6% | +6.09% | 2.72 | 49 |
| SWG-BO | 101 | 36.6% | −1.31% | 0.71 | 14 |
| SWG-REV | 14 | 21.4% | −4.70% | 0.19 | 17 |

**The pooled "NO-EDGE" verdict was a composition artifact** — 17 POS winners drowned by 115 bleeding swing trades (78 SL-hits at ~8d, 15% win). Per-family is the correct lens: **POS-BO is your real edge; the swing book (esp. SWG-BO/REV with the too-tight 1.5×ATR stop) is the drag.** The OOS gate must be run PER FAMILY, not pooled (POS n=17 still too small for its own gate — needs more anchors).

### Second regression still open
SWG-PB (Stage-2 Pullback) was the DOMINANT catalyst in May (56–66 picks/run) but is **0** in the June runs — a separate, undiagnosed regression (SWG-PB doesn't use `weinstein_setup`, so the squeeze fix doesn't touch it). Must trace its gate chain (`cpr_ok`/`mvwap_ok`/`rsi_pb_pocket`/`vol_drying`) vs Pine.

### Next Priority Work
(a) **Diagnose the SWG-PB regression** (dominant catalyst, now zero). (b) **Widen the SWG-BO/REV stop** (1.5×→2.5-3×ATR) — 78 SL-hits at 8d/15% win are the swing drag. (c) Re-run + gate PER FAMILY once SWG-PB is restored. (d) POS-BO edge (+7.67%, PF 3.14) is real but n=14 — accumulate more anchors before Phase 3. (e) RELIANCE Stage-4 exit.

## 4–5 June 2026 — MEGA SESSION: PA Conversion + Recovery Strengthening + Docs (HANDOFF)

> This was an enormous multi-thread session. Everything below is the authoritative state. Branch **`phase0-1-attribution-journal-snapshot`** (~50 commits, all PUSHED to origin, **NOT merged to main**).

### A. Phase 0/1 SHIPPED (journal/attribution)
- `performance_attribution.py` — realized-P&L decomposition across 11 dims incl. entry-signal drivers; quarantines incomplete rows (no NaN→0); signed-share-of-gross contribution. Wired into AUTOPSY page (5th "📐 Attribution" tab in `weinstein_commander_web_v4.0.py`).
- `journal_enrichment.py` — lean 6-col entry snapshot (setup/entry_stage/entry_alpha/entry_rs/entry_conviction/snapshot_meta) via `bull_screener.screen_symbol()`. Auto-captures on new OPEN trades (hook in `dhan_journal_v7.upsert_trade`).
- **Journal exit reconcile** — recovered 17 missing exits via Dhan API; fixed 2 silent bugs in `ai_reconcile_engine.fetch_trade_history` (token-outside-try; securityId→ticker via new `dhan_symbols.get_nse_secid_to_symbol`). True baseline: **−₹4,99,283 / 25.6% win / 0.24 PF** (was flattered to −₹39k by missing data). METALIETF/HDFCSML250 tranche reconstruction. Cash-park (LIQUID*) excluded.
- `journal_sync.py` — daily journal↔Dhan holdings reconcile (ADD/UPDATE/CLOSE-with-verified-exit; aborts if book empty). **Scheduled: Windows Task `TradingJournal_DhanSync`, daily 4:30 PM IST**, logs `logs/journal_sync.log`. Journal OPEN now = live book (8 positions; DMART closed @4137.20).
- **RELIANCE = Stage 4 violation, still OPEN** — Jay's trade to exit (~₹1.92L → rotate to Golden Picks). DMART already exited.

### B. THE BIG ONE — Bull catalyst blackout + Pure Price-Action conversion
- **Root cause of "catalysts disappeared":** `bull_screener.weinstein_setup` AND-ed `ma_sqz+bb_sqz` (squeeze) into the POS base gate — mutually exclusive with breakout → **0 POS picks for 24 months** (recent regression vs Pine line 1622). Also SWG-PB stripped of quality gates; SWG-REV had a logic contradiction.
- **Jay's directive (CANONICAL):** replace lagging indicators (RSI/MACD/BB/ADX) with **pure price action wherever possible**; don't break logic; don't over-tighten (multi-level funnel compounds).
- **Direction reconciled:** Python price-action is CANONICAL; Pine synced UP to it (not the reverse). I initially mis-synced (imported Pine's ADX/RSI) and reverted to PA.
- **Indicator→PA map:** RSI>60/50 → close>close[10]&[5]; ADX → ≥7/14 up-bars w/ higher highs; weekly RSI → wClose>wClose[5]; POS-ACCUM RSI≤50 → close≤close[5]×1.05; SWG-PB RSI-pocket → 38-62% retrace; SWG-REV RSI<35 → prior 3-bar-down + reversal bar.
- **Synced across:** `bull_screener.py` + `Weinstein_Unified_Ecosystem_v3.4.pine` + `Commander_Bull_Screener_v3.2.pine` + `Weinstein and Swing Pro Dashboard v67.4.12.pine`. **Pine files were INCONSISTENT with each other** (Commander alpha was already PA; Unified+v67 weren't) — now harmonized. **Jay confirmed he recompiled all 3 in TradingView — they compiled clean.**
- Macro-edge volume term added to Python alpha for parity. Catalyst FUNNEL diagnostics added (bull + recovery) — the tool that found every blackout.
- **Validated edge (24mo nifty500, matched windows, per-family):** POS-ACCUM +3.20%, SWG-BO +1.80%, SWG-REV +0.95%, POS-BO +0.60%. Pooled looks weak only due to composition (SWG-PB drag). Edge concentrated in DOWN tapes (defensive profile).

### C. SWG-PB — PARKED (Jay's favourite, but regime-mismatched)
Diagnosed exhaustively: signal finds upside (+9.84% runup) but 90% stopped early; tried wider stop (worse), quality gates (alpha_ok over-restricts pullbacks), confirmation bar, 60d window, EMA20-structural-floor stop. **Robustly negative — it's a momentum-continuation setup in a corrective regime (wrong tool now).** Current gates: minervini + bull_pullback + is_vcp_tight + pb_pocket_pa(38-62%) + pb_vol_dry + close>prior-high; stop = EMA20 floor; window 60d. Needs regime-conditioning (only fire in confirmed up-trends) — future work.

### D. Recovery STRENGTHENED (Jay: "only fundamentally strong beaten-down stocks")
- **RFF hard gate 1→4/6** (`rff_min_score`) — only fundamentally strong; INSUFFICIENT blocked. RFF Tier-A 6 checks + Tier-B bonus. (recovery_screener.py)
- **REV-CB drawdown 25% → 15–35% BAND** (`cb_drawdown_pct`=15, `cb_drawdown_max_pct`=35) — quality on sale not falling knives. Climax detect 0.5%→5.2%.
- **REV-EARLY un-blackouted (0→firing):** breakout AND→OR, vol-dry-up demoted to optional, `vol_confirm_mult` 1.5→1.25, and **strict-trend-UP gate DROPPED** (binary → made it "late"; breakout is now the early turn-confirm).
- **REV-RS stop widened** low10-0.2ATR → low20-0.5ATR (62% SL-hit on 90d hold before +9.84% runup). Shares SL with REV-EARLY.
- **Edge validated (90d windows): positive in DOWN/recovering tapes** — REV-CB +1.72%, REV-EARLY +0.68%, REV-RS -1.07% (weak link). Negative in up-tapes (correct — don't run recovery in a bull market). **Live screen: 7 signals, all RFF≥4.**
- **Pine = intentional RFF-Lite** (TradingView 5-call ceiling). Trade recovery off PYTHON, not Pine.

### E. Infra: `data_provider.py` hard download timeout
`yf.download` wrapped in daemon thread + `join(timeout)` (30s/60s) — a stalled yfinance connection froze a run ~15h. Now aborts → fallback. Protects all runs + the daily journal sync. **New params: `YF_DOWNLOAD_TIMEOUT_S`.**

### F. ⏳ DETACHED RUN IN FLIGHT
`nohup python validation.py --months 24 --universe nifty500 --screener recovery --catalyst_windows` (PID 2205) → **log: `validation_runs/_rev_rs_rerun.log`**. Confirms the REV-RS stop fix (alpha by tape + SL-hit% drop). Recovery runs take ~2-3h (per-anchor fundamental fetches). **Next session: read that log, run `catalyst_regime_partition.py` on the new LAST_RUN.**

### G. Docs (in progress — Jay: "rewrite all guides by reading modules")
- ✅ DONE (rewritten from code): `docs/11_Bull_Screener_v3_3_Guide.md` (new, removed v3_2), `docs/09_Recovery_Screener_v2_1_Guide.md` (new, removed v2_0), `docs/16_Validation_Framework_Guide.md` (rewritten in place), `docs/00_INDEX.md` (updated). `01_Swing_Zigzag` was already done by Jay.
- ⏳ REMAINING: `13_Unified_Ecosystem` (~1040L) + `08_Dashboard_v67` (~1030L) — agreed plan: **targeted PA-sync** of catalyst/alpha sections (not full rewrite — most content still valid). `07_Commander_Web_v4` (add Attribution tab). `19` NEW Journal/Attribution guide. `18_Trade_Checklist` (stale POS-ACCUM RSI refs → PA). Verify unchanged: 02/03/04/10/12/15 (didn't change this session).

### H. THE RECURRING LESSON (saved to memory)
Across POS-BO, SWG-PB, REV-RS: **the signals find edge; tight stops on long holds give it back.** Signal generation > exit calibration. Always read backtest verdicts PER-FAMILY × DIRECTION, never pooled. Never judge a positional/recovery setup on a 30-day window. Price-action is canonical; sync Pine UP to Python.

### Next Priority Work
(a) Read `_rev_rs_rerun.log`, confirm REV-RS, partition. (b) Finish docs (13/08 targeted PA-sync, 07, new 19, 18). (c) RELIANCE Stage-4 exit. (d) REV-RS weak-link + SWG-PB regime-conditioning. (e) Merge branch → main. (f) Optional: strip diagnostic funnels; per-family OOS gate before Phase 3.
